Graph Explaination:
1. The Fruchterman Reingold and Force Atlas2 algorithm are executed to prevent overlap among different movies and provide symmetric overlook
2. The font is set to an appropriate size and high contrast color to the nodes and edge and movie text can deliver maximum information compared to id
2. The different node color and size ranking can highlight more visualization to the users about which movies are classical, technically have high eccentricity compared to others
